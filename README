======================
To Compile from Source
======================

You'll need a JDK (I used openjdk-7-jdk) and ant, and the development libraries for SDL :

    aptitude install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-gfx1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev

You'll also need the  build tools for the native c code :

    aptitude install build-essential

Then building should be easy :

    ant clean
    ant

============================
Running the Test Application
============================

java -Djava.library.path=native/`uname -m` -cp jame.jar uk.co.nickthecoder.jame.test.TestVideo
