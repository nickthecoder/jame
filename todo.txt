Converting JAME to SDL2
=======================

ToDo
====

Mouse events to have "pressed" rather than "state".
    Remove the static final ints  PRESSED and RELEASED.

Refactor Texture.getPixel into Renderer?

"What pixel goes here" feature.
    Uses all the parameters of the complex Renderer.copy and return the pixel that would be at a given point
    Useful for testing the pixel at the mouse pointer.

Complex pixel overlapping feature
    Given a Rect on the destination...
    render a bunch of stuff from source A
    render a bunch of stuff from source B
    Find out if anything from A overlapped B

Implement Text events

Tests / Examples

    Rotate and scale textures
    Text events. Display what is being typed in. Try unicode characters such as Â°.


Class Keys uses the virtual key values, rather than the physical key scan code: not useful for most games.
    Either replace it with physical keys, or create a new class called VKeys.
    Itchy should use scan codes most of the time.
    Make Keys and enum (if it isn't already).
