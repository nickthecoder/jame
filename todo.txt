Converting JAME to SDL2
=======================

ToDo
====

Rebuild all JNI headers, and check that the .c files haven't missed any functions.
    Order the function in the .c files in the same order as the .h
    
Expand the test application
    Menu screen. Press a key to try each  sub screen...
    
    Renderering to a Texture
    Fullscreen windows (both kinds)
    Mouse events - drag a rectangle within a window. (Have lots of them just for fun?)
    Keyboard events : up, down, meta, shift etc.
    Text events. Display what is being typed in. Try unicode characters such as Â°.


event.c commented out code because ACTIVEEVENT and SDL_VIDEORESIZE are no longer valid.
implement key presses using new SDL events (which is unicode compliant - Yah!)

Implement Text events

Compile under windows
