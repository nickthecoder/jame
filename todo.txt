Converting JAME to SDL2
=======================

ToDo
====

Rebuild all JNI headers, and check that the .c files haven't missed any functions.
    Order the function in the .c files in the same order as the .h

Refactor Texture.getPixel into Renderer?

"What pixel goes here" feature.
    Uses all the parameters of the complex Renderer.copy and return the pixel that would be at a given point
    Useful for testing the pixel at the mouse pointer.

Complex pixel overlapping feature
    Given a Rect on the destination...
    render a bunch of stuff from source A
    render a bunch of stuff from source B
    Find out if anything from A overlapped B

Implement Text events

Tests / Examples

    Rotate and scale textures
    Text events. Display what is being typed in. Try unicode characters such as Â°.


event.c commented out code because ACTIVEEVENT and SDL_VIDEORESIZE are no longer valid.

Class Keys uses the virtual key values, rather than the physical key scan code: not useful for most games.
    Either replace it with physical keys, or create a new class called VKeys.
    Itchy should use scan codes most of the time.
