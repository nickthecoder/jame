Jame is a thin Java layer on top of SDL, giving an object oriented API to low level graphics and sound etc.
The aim is to allow writing high performance, cross platform, 2D games in Java.

It does not include any 3D or GL support, and there are no plans to ever support 3D.

Jame is NOT a game engine, it is only thin layer. However, the reason that I created Jame was to use within my
own Java 2D game engine, called Itchy. So if you want to write 2D games, check out Itchy!


===========================
Linux : Compile from Source
===========================

You'll need a JDK (I used openjdk-7-jdk) and ant, and the development libraries for SDL :

    aptitude install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-gfx1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev

You'll also need the  build tools for the native c code :

    aptitude install build-essential

Then building should be easy :

    ant clean
    ant

This should compile the java and the native C code.

Windows
=======

I'm a linux programmer, and have developed this code almost 100% in linux. I have compiled it using Windows,
and it works fine. However, I don't know the best way to set up the build environment, or how to include dependent
dlls. Linux is much better in this regard, because the package manager does all this for you, but it seems that
you have to do all this by hand when using Windows - please tell me that I'm wrong!

So at the moment, if you are unlucky enough to be stuck without linux, you'll have to assemble the dependencies manually.
The version numbers below are the ones I used when I last compiled the code under Windows, feel free to try later
versions if available.

To build Jame you need the following source code packages in src/native/win32-dependencies :

SDL-1.2.15
SDL_gfx-2.0.24
SDL_image-1.2.12
SDL_mixer-1.2.12
SDL_ttf-2.0.11

To use Jame under windows you need the following dlls in native/win32 :

libFLAC-8.dll
libfreetype-6.dll
libjpeg-8.dll
libmikmod-2.dll
libogg-0.dll
libpng15-15.dll
libtiff-5.dll
libvorbis-0.dll
libvorbisfile-3.dll
libwebp-2.dll
SDL.dll
SDL_gfx.dll
SDL_image.dll
SDL_mixer.dll
SDL_ttf.dll
smpeg.dll
zlib1.dll
